# hello-world
My first repository
Hello, World!

I remember writing my first ever hello world code, years ago in C++
I was learning it back in school, which just seems like a different lifetime
I'm now studying finance & trying to learn a bit of data analytics that I can use in the field
I'm currently learning how to program in R
And I'm using git & github for the first time in the process
